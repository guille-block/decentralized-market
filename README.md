# decentralized-market

## Motivation

This Dapp is my first decentralized project where the aim was to develop a marketplace for people to post and exchange fictional products.

## How it works

The Aplication counts on two main parts. First, a section where people can post their products. In order for a product to be available for submition, it needs to have a name and value. If the name and a value are not present the transaction will be rejected. On the other hand, we have a second section where anyone can check out the published products and buy them if they like them.

## Improvements

A useful feature for customers would be a simple search box where it would display an specific product. This improves the Dapp as a customer wouldn't need to scroll down to find the product they want to buy.
